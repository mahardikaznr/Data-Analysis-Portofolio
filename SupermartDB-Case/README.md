# Supermart DB casesðŸ“Š
Hi there!

In this project I use SupermartDB to answer 3 Business Questions with Postgresql only.
This database contains 3 tables. Customer, sales, and product tables. I need to Categorizing customers based on region and age, querring top 5 selling in East region and 5 least selling in South region, and make some Total Revenue loss or Discount for each product.

You can read cases defined in png and query files. Enjoy!
